<p align='justify'>This script provides time series forecasting with a simple MLP model. It preprocesses data, encodes time-related info, scales data, and generates input sequences. The MLP, using TensorFlow/Keras, has layers tailored for the forecast horizon. Early stopping prevents overfitting, and evaluation uses MSE and MAE.</p>
