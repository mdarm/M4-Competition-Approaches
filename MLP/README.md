This study primarily serves educational purposes and is uniquely crafted for global forecasting of the M4 dataset. Our approach involves the utilization of one-hot vector representations for each day and the construction of a deep MLP comprising two hidden layers. For comprehensive data preparation, we meticulously applied detrending, deseasonalizing, and standardization techniques. To efficiently manipulate input/target windows, we deployed a custom WindowGenerator class for batch generation across training, evaluation, and test datasets. Notably, our model is specifically designed to facilitate multi-step window forecasting for single-point predictions, offering a valuable educational tool for exploring timeseries analysis within the context of the M4 dataset.
