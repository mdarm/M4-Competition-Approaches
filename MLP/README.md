# Implementing and Assessing Various Solutions of the M4 Competition 

This repository hosts a comprehensive project focused on implementing and critically comparing various acknowledged methodologies utilized in the M4 Forecasting Competition. The project was conceived and carried out as a key part of the curriculum for the 'DI503 - Time Series Analysis and Applications' course, taught at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) during the Spring term of 2023. 

The aim of this project is to foster a deep understanding of different forecasting models and strategies, as well as their practical applications, by drawing on real-world scenarios from the M4 Competition. Our comparison framework aims to provide clarity on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, ultimately serving as a useful resource for future reference.
