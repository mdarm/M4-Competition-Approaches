The provided Python script offers a versatile time series forecasting methodology centered around a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. It begins by loading and preprocessing time series data, addressing missing values and removing trends and seasonality for non-yearly frequencies. Key time-related information, such as days of the week for hourly data, is incorporated via one-hot encoding. The dataset is scaled for normalization, and input sequences along with target values are generated for training. The MLP model, constructed using TensorFlow/Keras, consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, tailored to the chosen forecast horizon. The model is trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting, and its performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

The training loss and MAE initially improved in the first epoch but started to deteriorate in subsequent epochs. This could be an indication that the model might be overfitting the training data. The validation metrics (loss and MAE) followed a similar trend, increasing as the training progressed. This suggests that the model's performance on the validation dataset also deteriorated over time. The test evaluation results (test loss and MAE) are consistent with the trend observed in the validation set, indicating that the model did not generalize well to the test data.

To potentially improve the model's performance, we could consider the following steps:

- Adjust the model architecture: Experiment with different architectures, including the number of layers and units in the neural network, activation functions, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.
- Modeling time as a vector, also known as "time embeddings" or "time encoding," can be beneficial for time series forecasting tasks, especially when dealing with periodic patterns or seasonal variations in your data. We can capture the cyclic nature of time, such as daily, weekly, or yearly patterns, by encoding time-related information into a continuous vector representation. This approach has the potential to improve forecasting accuracy compared to treating time as a simple numeric or categorical feature (e.g. Capturing Seasonality).
